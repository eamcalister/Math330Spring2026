  "body": "  Partial Differential Equations\/Advanced Topics Syllabus  Math 330\/483 - Spring 2026     Mathematics Department Fort Lewis College  Last Updated:             Course Information    Course Title  Partial Differential Equations\/Advanced Topics in Mathematics   Course Number  MATH 330\/438   Credits  3   Times and Rooms     Time and Room(s): MWF 2:30-3:25, Noble 160    Instructor    Erich McAlister ( mcalister_e@fortlewis.edu )        Course Description   For Math 330 :This course is an introduction to linear partial differential equations of order one and two. The primary applications are vibrations and heat flow in both bounded and unbounded domains. Integral transform and series methods are emphasized.   For Math 483 : In addition to the topics of Math 330, students will prove rigorous analytic results on Fourier series\/transforms to understand the subtle nature of solutions to PDE.    Instructional Format  This is a face-to-face course, which means we will meet in person.    Course Materials  Required Text: Applied Partial Differential Equations, 3rd Edition , by J. David Logan, ISBN: 9783319124926.   You will be asked to read sections of the textbook prior to some classes and engage with the text in a meaningful way.     Student Office Hours      Erich McAlister's Office Hours: MWF 3:30-4:30pm in the PEC. Additional hours are available by appointment.       Feedback and Communication  Communication of all course information will occur via Canvas as well as in class. Most assignments will be submitted and graded online in Canvas.     Missing Class  It is expected that you will be in class, on time, for every class meeting. This maximizes your opportunity to learn and your teacher's ability to help you learn. If you must miss class, be sure to check Canvas and Webwork for assignments, and try to get notes from a classmate. If you're still having difficulty with the material, use office hours or the Peer Education Center to get caught up. If you need an extension on an assignment, just ask your professor and it will likely be granted.  If you need to miss class for an extended period of time, let your professor know so that we may work out a remote accommodation.    Technology and Software Requirements  You will need to be able to access Canvas to submit assignments online. Internet access and a scanning device are required. Calculuators may be permitted on some exams.       Learning Outcomes    Course Learning Outcomes     Students demonstrate a conceptual understanding of the meaning of algebraic forms, and recognize differences between algebraic expressions and equations.    Students demonstrate proficiency in evaluating, interpreting, and manipulating algebraic expressions and equations.    Students develop competency in understanding functions. This includes definition and interpretation of various presentations of functions (algebraic, graphical, verbal, tabular) as well as understanding domain and range, compositions and decompositions, and inverses.    Students will derive fundamental first and second order linear PDE from physical considerations (conservation laws).    Students will solve basic first and second order PDE on bounded and unbounded domains using various methods, including techniques of Fourier analysis.    (483) Students will prove fundamental analytic results (involving various forms of convergence) relevant to partial differential equations.         Course Requirements and Grading   Final grades will be determined using the following assignment categories (descriptions below):    Assignment Category  Weight    Homework  30%    Three Midterm Exams  15% each    Cumulative Final Exam  25%    Grading Scale    Letter Grade Point Range ( )    A    A-    B+    B    B-    C+    C    C-    D+    D    D-    F     Homework  Homework will be assigned daily and due two class periods later. Each problem will be graded on a scale from 0 to 3. A grade of 0 indicates there is nothing correct about your solution. A grade of 3 indicates your solution is correct with no mistakes. A grade of 2 is mostly correct, with minor mistakes. A grade of 1 has a correct idea, but needs some serious work.  Additional assignments for Math 483 will be due weekly.    Midterm Exams  There will be three midterm exams given in class on 2\/6, 3\/6, and 4\/10. The class day before exams will be reserved for review.    Cumulative Final Exam  Your cumulative final exam will be Wednesday, April 29, from 12-2pm.      Course Expectations   Save Your Spot  Stay enrolled in this and your other courses this term by attending class and participating in required course activities during the first week of the term. Instructors have the option to disenroll a student from a class if the student has missed at least one scheduled class in person or via Zoom or required online course activity for online courses (check your syllabus for information) during the first 4 days of the week in which the course is scheduled to meet for the first time. This allows students who are on the course waitlist to be added to the course.    Course Workload and Time Management  How can you create a weekly schedule based on your courses and study time needed for success? As long as you know the number of credit hours you are taking, it’s easy! In a face-to-face class, one course credit is the same as one hour of lecture per week for a 15-week term. Additionally, you need to plan for a minimum of two more hours of preparation for each credit hour (and that's according to the federal definition of a credit hour). Thus, in this face-to-face 4-credit course we will meet in person for 4 hours per week, and you should plan on a minimum average of 8 hours per week of homework, reading, and preparation outside of class. Some weeks it may be less; some weeks it may be more. This weekly amount of homework and preparation time will typically vary based on a number of factors about you as a learner and student. Please let me know if you fall behind or need any help figuring out your weekly schedule and meeting these course workload expectations.    Diversity and Inclusive Classroom Statements  Each member of this class is responsible for contributing to and maintaining an atmosphere of respect for all other members. This means each of us is responsible for ensuring that:    All perspectives and experiences are respected.    Class discussions and individual comments are respectful and do not degrade, stereotype, or promote deficit thinking about any group or individual.    Each person in the class has an opportunity to articulate their perspective and ideas without being demeaned.    Students who demonstrate a disregard for this responsibility will be alerted that their attitudes and\/or actions inhibit a respectful and safe learning environment. The instructor reserves the right to take appropriate disciplinary action.      Email and Netiquitte  “Netiquette” is a protocol for interacting and behaving online. Although digital interactions are not face-to-face, they affect real people; thus, we must be sensitive to the fact that our words impact others. The following are an outline of ways that you can communicate professionally and sensitively online:    Be sensitive to others' cultural, social, political and linguistic backgrounds. Everyone is different and unique. Remember to show respect for our differences.    Incorporate professionalism and good taste when composing responses in discussion forums, online collaboration and feedback tools, and other interactive spaces. Avoid profanity and other harsh comments. Minimize your use of slang, as it can be misinterpreted.    Avoid using all capital letters as it can be construed as “shouting” online, which can be perceived as aggressive behavior.    When using acronyms, make sure to clarify its meaning when you first use in your message.    Proofread your responses for accuracy and tone.        Campus Policies   Academic Integrity   What is Academic Integrity? Integrity is the College-wide expectation that students follow established guidelines and common knowledge to maintain ethical standards in their work.   Why does it matter? Integrity in academic matters is vital to all members of the College community. An academic integrity violation by a student devalues the accomplishments of other students, threatens the integrity of the College, and undermines the College's educational mission. During their time at FLC, students are expected to know, understand, and comply with the ethical standards of the College.   What is Academic Dishonesty? Academic dishonesty is defined as any form of unethical or illegal behavior regarding any academic work--with or without intent. These standards apply to all courses taken on or off campus, and all modes of course delivery.  Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, the following:    plagiarism,    cheating,    fabrication and falsification,    multiple submissions\/self-plagiarism,    misuse of academic materials,    unapproved and uncredited use of artificial intelligence,    and complicity in academic dishonesty.    See the full definition of academic dishonesty here: FLCs-Definition-of-Academic-Dishonesty.   If a faculty member alleges that you have committed an academic integrity violation, they will communicate with you and explain the alleged charges and then submit a report of academic dishonesty using this form: Report of Academic Dishonesty.   Faculty may use any legal and ethical method when identifying an academic integrity violation, including the use of plagiarism detection software and artificial intelligence detection software.   What are the consequences? In-class consequences for a charge can range from a reduced grade or zero on the assignment to a reduced grade or “F” in the course. College-wide consequences can range from academic intervention to suspension or expulsion.    Course Policy on use of Generative Artificial Intelligence:  Use of GAI (such as ChatGPT) without citation is forbidden in this class. The goal is to understand difficult material and GAI will not be nearly as helpful as asking your professor questions and carefully reading your textbook.    Digital Accessibility  Fort Lewis College commits to ensuring that information technology and digital content it creates or distributes in its programs, services and activities is accessible to all individuals. The Policy on Accessibility of Information Technology and Digital Content reflects Fort Lewis College's commitment to providing access to information technology and digital content to all FLC students, employees and the general public.    Accessibility Resource Center  The Accessibility Resource Center provides inclusive, personalized, caring accommodations for students needing disability-related support. Students are encouraged to reach out to learn more and register for services.  Visit their website or email accessibilityresources@fortlewis.edu or call 970-247-7383.    Course Withdrawal Policy   The last day to withdraw from FLC classes with a grade of “CW” (course withdrawal) is Friday, October 31 at 4pm. This is a college-wide deadline that is not negotiable.  To withdraw from a course using a CW, fill out our online Withdrawal From Course Form at your Student Resource Center . You can also visit Skyhawk Station and pick up a Course Withdrawal form, and our staff will process the CW for you on the spot. This Course Withdrawal will not affect your financial aid for this term, and you will still owe the full amount for the class on your student bill. You should also be aware that dropping a course could affect your Pace Towards Graduation, impacting your eligibility for Financial Aid.      FLC Student Resources   Basic Needs Statement  The Grub Hub cares about your personal and academic success.
