In this activity students are asked to decide when to switch the tangent line approximation they use to approximate square roots.    Set-up  Recall from class that we can approximate square roots of numbers that aren't perfect squares using the tangent line approximation near some number  where .  For instance, to approximate we decided to use the tangent line approximation at the nearest perfect square, which is given by  Thus, we can estimate .  Now, what if there isn't a \"nearest\" perfect square? For instance, which tangent line should we use to approximate ( is exactly halfway between and )? The following exercise will help us figure out the answer.     The graph of , along with its tangent lines at and , is given by .
