  "title": "Math 330 ODE Review",
  "body": " Math 330 ODE Review     See how much ODE material we remember.    See if we can apply our knowledge of ODEs in new ways.      Before we begin the study of partial differential equations (PDEs), we need to make sure we have a strong command of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and multivariable Calculus. These topics must be understood both from a procedural point of view and conceptually. In this worksheet you'll test your understanding and procedural proficiency with ODEs, on Wednesday we'll do multivariable Calculus. The goal right now is to find out where we stand with background material.    Terminology Questions  Here are some questions of terminology. Answer each of them in the context of the differential equations class you previously took.    What is a differential equation ?      What does it mean to solve a differential equation ?      Given two functions and , what is the convolution , , and what is it good for?      What is the  -function and what is it good for?     Solving Exercises   For each of these questions, and all that you answer from now on, you need to explain your reasoning as you go. At the end of the question, if possible, try to conclude with a statement saying why the answer you obtained makes sense from a practical point of view.     A brine solution containing kg of salt per liter of water flows into a L mixing vat at a rate of L\/min. A well-stirred mixture leaves at a rate of L\/min. If the vat is initially full of fresh water, find a formula for the quantity of salt in the tank as a function of time.      A damped oscillator is governed by the 2nd order ODE when no external force is applied to it. Its initial position is and has a velocity of . At , an external force of is applied. Show that, in the long run, is approximately a periodic function. What is the period and amplitude of this function?      Consider the second order ODE Suppose is a non-negative integer. By guessing a power series solution, show that this equation has a polynomial solution for some initial conditions. Does it have polynomial solutions for all initial conditions?      "

  "body": " Math 330 Multivariable Calculus Review     See how much Calc III material we remember.    See if we can apply our knowledge of multivariable Calculus in new ways.      The study of PDEs depends pretty heavily on a good understanding of multivariable Calculus. Indeed, because of their physical origins, understanding PDEs may actually depend more on understanding multivariable Calculus than understanding ODEs. The following questions demand both procedural fluency and conceptual understanding of multivariable Calculus.    A Traveling Wave   Suppose that is any differentiable function of one variable. Define .     Use the multivariable chain rule to show that satisfies the PDE       If you graph in the -plane and let vary, what happens to the graph of ? Use this to give a geometric\/dynamic\/physical argument for why satisfies the PDE given above.      Let be the unit vector parallel to the line in the -plane. Compute the directional derivative . Explain why the answer makes sense and connects to satisfying the PDE given above in as many ways as you can.     Using the Divergence Theorem   Suppose satisfies for all closed surfaces in some region of space . Use the Divergence Theorem to explain why (i.e. prove that) at all points of .       Homogeneous Functions   A function is homogeneous of degree one if for all .     What does it mean graphically for a function to be homogeneous of degree one?      Suppose that is homogeneous of degree one. Use the definition of the directional derivative (and that it equals the dot product shortcut) to show that satisfies the PDE     The last question is a little hard. Let . Taking the directional derivative in the direction of the unit vector and using homogeneity will get you there.      Explain what the above equation means in terms of directional derivatives, and why satisfying the equation makes sense based on part (a).      Give two examples of functions that are homogeneous of degree one that have qualitatively different graphs.      "
