    <p>
      <term>For Math 330</term>:This course is an introduction to linear partial differential equations of order one and two. The primary applications are vibrations and heat flow in both bounded and unbounded domains. Integral transform and series methods are emphasized.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>For Math 483</term>: In addition to the topics of Math 330, students will prove rigorous analytic results on Fourier series/transforms to understand the subtle nature of solutions to PDE.

    <p>
      It is expected that you will be in class, on time, for every class meeting. This maximizes your opportunity to learn and your teacher's ability to help you learn. If you must miss class, be sure to check Canvas and Webwork for assignments, and try to get notes from a classmate. If you're still having difficulty with the material, use office hours or the Peer Education Center to get caught up. If you need an extension on an assignment, just ask your professor and it will likely be granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to miss class for an extended period of time, let your professor know so that we may work out a remote accommodation.
